Mixing C and Assembly


__*Prelab*__

The following taable is data given in the C Compiler User's Guide, which given information pertinent to the lab:

|__Size__|__Signed/Unsigned__|__Type__|__Min value__|__Max value__|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|8-bit|unsigned|unsigned char|0|255|
|8-bit|signed|signed char|-128|127|
|16-bit|unsigned|unsigned short/unsigned int|0|65,535|
|16-bit|signed|signed short/signed int|-32,768|32,767|
|32-bit|unsigned|unsigned long|0|4,294,967,295|
|32-bit|signed|signed long|-2,147,483,648|2,147,483,647|
|64-bit|unsigned|unsigned long long|0|18,446,744,073,709,551,615|
|64-bit|signed|signed long long|-9,223,372,036,854,775,808|9,223,372,036,854,775,807|

Because space is limited on microcontrollers, it is a common practice to use variables with a range suitable for the task at hand. Unfortunately, there is no standard among C compilers between the basic data types like char, short, long and the number of bits in the underlying data representation. Furthermore, when writing and reading code, it is not readily apparent how many bits are in a short or long variable. Consequently, we will write our programs using typed definitions that provide an obvious connection between the data type and the number of bits in the representation. The following table is the meaning and typedef declarations of different types in C:

|__Type__|__Meaning__|__C typedef declaration__|
|:--|:--|:--|
|int8|unsigned 8-bit value|typedef unsigned char int8|
|sint8|signed 8-bit value|typedef signed char sint8|
|int16|unsigned 16-bit value|typedef unsigned short int16|
|sint16|signed 16-bit value|typedef signed short sint16|
|int32|unsigned 32-bit value|typedef unsigned long sint32|
|sint32|signed 32-bit value|typedef signed long sint32|
|int64|unsigned 64-bit value|typedef unsigned long long int64|
|sint64|signed 64-bit value|typedef signed long long sint64|

I then made a project around simpleLab4.c. I used CCS to step through the program and examined the a, b, c, d, e variables in main, just after the call to the function `func` in line 16.

|__Iteration__|__a__|__b__|__c__|__d__|__e__|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|1st|10|9|8|7|10|
|2nd|16|15|14|13|16|
|3rd|22|21|20|19|22|
|4th|28|27|26|25|28|
|5th|34|33|32|31|34|

Then I examined the assembly code generated by the compiler. To fill in the following table with the appropriate values, I had to do a few things. Firstly, I found the code for the function `func` and wrote down the starting and ending address in the table below. Next, I identified which registers were used to pass the input parameters from main to the function. I then wrote their identities below. If it wass not clear which register held which input parameter, I tested it out! Finally, I determined which register was used to return the value from func to main.

|__Parameter__|__Value Sought__|
|:--|:--|
|Starting address of `func`|0xC0BA|
|Ending address of `func`|0xC0C6|
|Register holding w|R12|
|Register holding x|R13|
|Register holding y|R14|
|Register holding z|R15|
|Register holding return value|R12|
